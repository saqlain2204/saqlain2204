## About

HeyðŸ‘‹! I'am Mohammed Saqlain, a pre-final year student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI and Machine Learning. I am enthusiast in the world of technology and sciences. My work experiences include:

- [Boltzmann Labs](https://www.boltzmann.co) (Research Intern, June 2024 - Aug 2024)
- [3Analytics](https://3analytics.com/) (LLM intern, Aug 2023 - Jan 2024)

I specialize in developing innovative products that streamline daily tasks, harnessing the power of Generative AI. Currently, I'm deeply involved in building [AstuteAI](https://astuteai.streamlit.app), where we strive to enhance user productivity and convenience through cutting-edge AI technologies. My fascination with deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) fuels my commitment to staying abreast of advancements in this dynamic field. Beyond technology, I lead a dynamic life as both a professional cricketer and a black-belt holder in karate, where discipline and agility are paramount. I occasionally share insights through articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@vanishingradiant), exploring topics at the intersection of AI, experiences and daily life. 

I am driven by a genuine desire to make a positive impact, aiming to leverage my skills to assist others effectively. You can reach out to me via [Email](mailto:saqlain.contact@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/saqlain2204). View my portfolio [here](https://saqlain2204.github.io).
